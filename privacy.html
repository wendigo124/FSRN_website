      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 16, 2025</p>
      <p>Welcome to Füd! This Privacy Policy explains how Ouro LLC ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and
        protects your information when you use our mobile application, Füd (the "App"). Please read this policy
        carefully.</p>
      <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your email address is required to create and manage your account,
          authenticate your access, and communicate with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional & Health Data:</strong> Information you provide through the App, such as food entries,
          meal details, macronutrient and micronutrient intake, dietary goals, consumption history, and potentially
          other related metrics you choose to track.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect general information about how you interact with the App (e.g.,
          features used, crash reports) solely for the purpose of improving app functionality and stability. This data
          is typically aggregated and does not directly identify you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not collect:</strong> Your name (unless you voluntarily include it in communications), physical
        address, phone number, precise geolocation, or government-issued identifiers.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the App's core functionality, including tracking your nutritional intake
          and progress towards your goals.</li>
        <li>To provide personalized, AI-driven nutritional insights based on the data you log.</li>
        <li>To authenticate your account and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>To respond to your support requests and inquiries.</li>
        <li>To improve the App's features, performance, and user experience (using aggregated or anonymized data where
          possible).</li>
        <li>To maintain your dietary history and goal tracking within the App.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your personal data for targeted advertising by
          third parties.</strong></p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We limit the use of third-party services to those essential for app functionality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Insights (OpenAI):</strong> We transmit relevant nutritional data (like food logs and dietary
          goals, but not your email address) to OpenAI's API to generate personalized dietary insights within the App.
          OpenAI processes this data according to its API data usage policies, which may evolve. We recommend you review
          <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's API Data Usage Policies</a>. While we configure our requests according to
          their guidelines, we cannot control OpenAI's data handling practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend Hosting & Database (e.g., Heroku, MongoDB Atlas):</strong> Your data (including email and
          nutritional data) is stored on servers managed by third-party cloud hosting providers (like Heroku or similar)
          and database providers (like MongoDB Atlas or similar). These providers are responsible for the physical
          security of the servers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not use third-party analytics SDKs (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.) within the
          App.</strong> We do not share your personal information with data brokers, marketing partners, or advertising
        networks.</p>
      <p>We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good
        faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
        investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Your data is stored using services like MongoDB Atlas, hosted on cloud
          infrastructure (such as Heroku or similar platforms), primarily located in the United States.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to
          protect your information. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.
          <br>
          <strong class="warning">Important Security Note: Currently, we do not implement end-to-end encryption or
            encryption at rest for your stored nutritional data or account information within our primary database. Data
            transmission between the app and our backend, and between our backend and OpenAI's API, may also not be
            encrypted.</strong> This means there is a risk that your data could be intercepted or accessed by
          unauthorized parties. We are actively working towards implementing stronger encryption measures in future
          updates.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We retain your personal data as long as your account is active. If you delete
          your account, we will initiate the process to permanently delete your data from our production systems within
          30 days, unless retention is required for legal compliance, dispute resolution, or enforcing our agreements.
          Backup copies may exist for a limited period afterward before being securely deleted.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location (e.g., EU/UK, California), you may have certain rights regarding your personal data,
        including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request correction of inaccurate personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Deletion):</strong> You can request the deletion of your personal data, subject to
          certain exceptions. Deleting your account within the App typically initiates this process.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You may request a copy of your data in a structured,
          machine-readable format.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object/Restrict Processing:</strong> You may have the right to object to or request
          restriction of certain processing activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below. We may need to verify your identity
        before processing your request.</p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if required
        by applicable law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we
        have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.</p>

      <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located
        outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may
        differ from those in your jurisdiction (e.g., the United States). By using the App, you consent to this
        transfer.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Breach Notification</h2>
      <p>In the event of a data breach that compromises your personal information and poses a significant risk, we will
        take reasonable steps to notify affected users as required by applicable law. This may include notification via
        email or within the App.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting
        the new policy within the App or via email. The "Effective Date" at the top indicates when the latest revision
        came into effect. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new
        Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
